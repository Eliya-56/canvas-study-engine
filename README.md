# canvas-study-engine
Simple tetris engine for study purposes based on canvas 2D api.  
Here you have `TetrisEngine` and `GameCycle` classes.

## GameCycle
`GameCycle` class creates and manage cycle of rendering frames via [`requestAnimationFrame`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame).

Constructor takes 2 argumets : 

`gameObject` - is any object that has **render** method. 

`fps` (optional) - desired number of frames per second number. That means that real fps won't be more than specified here. Default value is 30.

## TetrisEngine
`TetrisEngine` class draw tetris field and gives method to manage it. 

Constructor creates canvas element and draw tetris field there. It takes 2 args: 

`parentElement` - HTMLElement where tetris field will be drawn.

`customConfig` (optional) - tetris field configuration.  
By default threre is a config object: 
```js
const config = {
    mainBorderWidth: 1,
    fieldWidth: 30,
    fieldInterval: 3,
    columnCount: 20,
    rowCount: 25,
    fieldBackgroundColor: "white",
    fieldBorderColor: "gray",
    fieldDefaultContentColor: "gray",
    highlightColor: "red",
    defaultLineWidth: 0.5,
    fullLineWidth: 1,
    defaultUseBorders: true,
    headerHeight: 80,
    headerMargin: 15
}
``` 
The most important here is `columnCount` and `rowCount` props that configure field size.
